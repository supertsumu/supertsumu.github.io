      <description>Home&#xA;picoCTF 2022 writeups picoCTF 2022&#xA;picoCTF is an annual high school ctf hosted by the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University. As usual, they came up with challenging and engaging challenges this year that made us utilize our practical skills. What I love about picoCTF’s challenges is that they make you use skills that you would use on-the-field which makes it a great place to learn practical skills. I alongside Team Excelsior tried our best for #816/7794 globally.</description>
