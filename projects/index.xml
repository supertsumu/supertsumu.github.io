      <description>Home&#xA;Pwnagotchi Build Guide (November 2023) The Pwnagotchi is an open source hacking mini war driving pet. It is inspired by the classic childer&amp;rsquo;s toy tamagotchi. But instead of feeding it virtual food, it feeds itself with WPA handshakes and PMKIDs!&#xA;Hardware wise, the bare minimum you need to make a pwnagotchi is a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a micro usb cable and a micro sd card. However, you would only be able to run the Pwnagotchi in &amp;ldquo;headless&amp;rdquo; mode in this configuration without a screen.</description>

      <description>Home&#xA;How to make a command-and-control (C2) server on the cloud A command-and-control server (C2) is a server where hackers control their victimâ€™s compromised computers via bind/reverse shells. They can come in the form of a simple netcat instance or fully developed frameworks that feature exploitation scripts such as Meterpreter and PowerSploit.&#xA;In this article, I will be demonstrating how I hosted my C2 server on the cloud and its capabilities using the Linode cloud hosting service.</description>

      <description>Home&#xA;Windows Defender Bypass with Villain and Obfuscation (14/12/2022) Windows Defender is a signature based antimalware system. This means that it checks programs against a library of previously identified malware to locate malicious software. Because of this, attackers can find ways to bypass Windows Defender by either creating new payloads or encoding/obfuscating existing payloads beyond recognition. Villain Click here to watch it in action Note: I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate it if you&amp;rsquo;re going to try this out, please turn off Windows Defender&amp;rsquo;s automatic sample submission.</description>

      <description>Home&#xA;I made a rubber ducky reverse shell for &lt;$10 (Win-10) USB Rubber Ducky by Hak5 The Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky is a small microcontroller that acts as a keyboard and automatically enters pre-programmed keystrokes. The original Rubber Ducky by Hak5 will cost you 60$. I will be making one for under 10$ with an Arduino pro micro and writing a script to start and conceal a Windows 10 reverse shell.</description>
